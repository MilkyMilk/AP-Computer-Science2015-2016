/* Order check. Write a program that takes three double values x, y, and z as command-line arguments and 
 * prints true if the values are strictly ascending or descending (x < y < z or x > y > z), and false otherwise.

Exercise 1.2.30

Uniform random numbers. Write a program that prints five uniform random values between 0 and 1, 
their average value, and their minimum and maximum value. Use Math.random(), Math.min(), and Math.max().

 

Remember:  You can not use if statements or any programming concepts beyond Section 1.2

Hint:  You might have to make a method call to Math.min() and Math.max() multiple times!
